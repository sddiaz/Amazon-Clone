[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project is a full-stack Amazon clone built using modern web technologies. It aims to replicate core Amazon functionalities such as user login/authenticaiton, payments, checkout, order history, some core settings, and more. 

## Demo & Design

*   Here is the [**Live Demo**](https://amazon-clone-example.vercel.app)
*   .. And the [**System Design**](https://www.figma.com/file/your-figma-file-id)

## Tech Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for server-side rendering and improved performance.
    *   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. (Consider adding if used)
    *   [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): Easily add icons to your React projects. (Consider adding if used)
*   **Backend & Database:**
    *   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/): Backend-as-a-service providing authentication, database (Firestore), and storage.
*   **Payment Processing:**
    *   [Stripe](https://stripe.com/): Secure and reliable payment gateway integration.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): (If used) Platform for easy deployment of Next.js applications.
*   **State Management:**
    *   [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html): (Or Redux/Zustand if used) For managing application state.

## Features

*   Product browsing with categories and search functionality.
*   Detailed product pages with images, descriptions, and reviews (if implemented).
*   Add to cart and shopping cart management.
*   Secure checkout process with Stripe integration.
*   User authentication (sign-up/sign-in).
*   Order history and management.
*   Responsive design for various screen sizes.
*   Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for improved SEO and performance (thanks to Next.js).

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [invalid URL removed]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd amazon-clone
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Firebase:**

    *   Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console ([https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)).
    *   Enable Authentication (Email/Password), Firestore, and Storage (if needed).
    *   Obtain your Firebase configuration (web config) and add it to a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
    ```

5.  **Set up Stripe:**

    *   Create a Stripe account ([https://dashboard.stripe.com/register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)).
    *   Obtain your Stripe publishable key and secret key. Add the publishable key to your `.env.local` file:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key # Keep this secure!
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```

7.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Further Improvements (Things to impress potential employers)

*   **Unit and Integration Tests:** Implement testing with Jest and React Testing Library to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **E2E Testing:** Add end-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright for comprehensive testing of user flows.
*   **Advanced State Management:** Consider using Redux, Zustand, or Recoil for more complex state management needs.
*   **Image Optimization:** Implement image optimization techniques for better performance.
*   **Search Functionality with Algolia or ElasticSearch:** Integrate a dedicated search service for improved search relevance and speed.
*   **Product Reviews and Ratings:** Implement a system for users to leave reviews and ratings for products.
*   **Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD):** Set up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar to automate builds and deployments.
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities by following accessibility best practices.
*   **Payment Security Best Practices:** Emphasize secure storage of sensitive information and adherence to PCI DSS standards.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for the codebase, including API documentation.
